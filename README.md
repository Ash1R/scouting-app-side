This is Team 972- Iron Claw's scouting app!
For those of you unfamiliar with FIRST Robotics, many top teams scout out other teams' performances for match strategy and picking partners for later statges of the competition. 
This app allows scouters to input data through a specially designed interface and view in tables or graphs. It can also export the data to a CSV file.
